Hi!
This is a final programming assignment for my DevOps class.
I made a good grade so I wanted to post it because it was really fun to make.

My program isn't going to work anymore because it pulls from a website that my teacher had set up, and he make take it down or change it.

HOWEVER,,, if it did work,,
you would input the external IP of a server that you wanted to startup and an ID for the type of server it would be.
Then the setup, such as downloading packages, would be completed for you!

A log would also be created that would detail what the kickoff.sh script did.

Overall, a very cool introduction to Bash and server automation.
